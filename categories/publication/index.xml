      <description>In June of this year, I uploaded my first first-author (there has to be a cleaner way of saying that) manuscript to the preprint server BioRxiv. This was a huge and important milestone for me, and I was incredibly excited to have it out for the world to see virtually as soon as it was done &amp;ndash; such is the power of preprint servers!
Like in most endeavours in science, however, there&#39;s always room for improvement, and I&#39;ve been very fortunate to have gotten some thorough feedback from both members of my committee as well as other researchers in the community at large.</description>
