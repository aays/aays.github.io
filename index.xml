      <title>A music CV</title>

      <description>I’m adding a ‘music CV’ to the site. Just not sure where else I’d be putting it.
This is largely spurred by my friend Cass and I finally releasing our debut album, Nighttime Heists / Daytime Getaways, after six years of work. That and the fact that I’ve contributed to some pals’ work. Don’t think my Metal Archives page is being updated soon either way (my bafflement at having one notwithstanding).</description>

      <title>Salt stress alters the spectrum of de novo mutation available to selection during experimental adaptation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://aays.github.io/projects/salt-lines/</link>

      <description>The genetic basis of adaptation is driven not only by selection, but also by the spectrum of available mutations. Given that the rate of mutation is not uniformly distributed across the genome and varies depending on the environment, understanding the signatures of selection across the genome is aided by first establishing what the expectations of genetic change are from mutation. To determine the interaction between salt stress, selection, and mutation across the genome, we compared the rates and patterns of mutation observed in a selection experiment for salt tolerance in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to those observed in mutation accumulation experiments with and without salt exposure.</description>

      <title>How and why to time your code - a quick primer</title>

      <description>Got a second?
There’s a frankly daunting amount of tools and practices most new researchers in genomics and computational biology could could get some serious mileage out of, and in some ways I am loath to add to the pile, but I maintain this one is particularly worth your time (heh).
I’m of course referring to timing the programs you run and scripts you write, which on the surface might sound like a ton of extra work for little benefit.</description>

      <title>Recombination rate variation and infrequent sex influence genetic diversity in C. reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://aays.github.io/projects/ld-paper/</link>

      <description>Recombination confers a major evolutionary advantage by breaking up linkage disequilibrium between harmful and beneficial mutations, thereby facilitating selection. However, in species that are only periodically sexual, such as many microbial eukaryotes, the realized rate of recombination is also affected by the frequency of sex, meaning that infrequent sex can increase the effects of selection at linked sites despite high recombination rates. Despite this, the rate of sex of most facultatively sexual species is unknown.</description>

      <description>Introduction So my shiny new Hugo/blogdown website has been up for two weeks now without me having posted anything about it, which goes to show that this second tweet:
[UPDATE: Tweet redacted due to broken Twitter API.]
was maybe a little optimistic. But better late than never! In this post, I’ll be discussing why I switched, how I got started, and a few key pointers that helped along the way.</description>

      <title>Recombination in the C. reinhardtii MT locus and consequences for selection efficacy</title>
      <link>https://aays.github.io/projects/mt-locus/</link>

      <description>‘Sex’ in C. reinhardtii is determined by a dimorphic, crossover-suppressed mating type locus, which encodes an individual as either MT+ or MT-. C. reinhardtii is isogamous (equal sized gametes) which means there are no sex differences; hence the term ‘mating type’. The two alleles of the MT locus can be thought of as ‘X and Y chromosomes’, except that each individual only carries one and that the alleles are genetically very similar.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Methods in R for Biology - a live-coding undergraduate course</title>

      <description>During the Fall 2018 and Fall 2019 semesters, I was part of the instructor team for a third-year course on quantitative methods in R, pitched by UofT Coders and adapted from Dr. Christie Bahlai&amp;rsquo;s Reproducible Quantitative Methods course. The course aims to teach undergraduate students at the third-year level or above the foundations for reproducible data analysis in R, and is taught entirely using the live-coding format used in Carpentries workshops.</description>

      <title>Consequences of recombination for mating type evolution in C. reinhardtii - a summary</title>

      <description>Motivation Volvocine algae have been a model lineage for studying the evolutionary transition from isogamy (equal sized gametes) to anisogamy (unequal sized gametes). Instead of entire sex chromosomes, isogamous systems tend to have smaller and less differentiated mating type (MT) loci. Part of this putatively stems from these systems simply having less secondary sexual characteristics, and thus comparatively minimal need to segregate certain genes in one MT allele over another (under the sexually antagonistic selection model).</description>

      <description>In June of this year, I uploaded my first first-author (there has to be a cleaner way of saying that) manuscript to the preprint server BioRxiv. This was a huge and important milestone for me, and I was incredibly excited to have it out for the world to see virtually as soon as it was done &amp;ndash; such is the power of preprint servers!
Like in most endeavours in science, however, there&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have gotten some thorough feedback from both members of my committee as well as other researchers in the community at large.</description>

      <title>Migrating an Overleaf project to GitHub</title>

      <guid>https://aays.github.io/post/migrating-an-overleaf-project-to-github/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big proponent of Overleaf for some time now, having written both committee reports and assignments in it to great success in my grad school career thus far. Recently, I expanded my horizons a bit and made my first conference poster in LaTeX &amp;ndash; something I admittedly found a bit head-spinning at first, but which eventually clicked just like everything else about LaTeX has in the past.
After returning from the conference (and recovering from a good bit of jet lag) I decided I wanted to preserve the project within a GitHub repo: code, plots, and all.</description>

      <description>Hyde-hyde is a responsive Hugo theme inspired by @spf13&amp;rsquo;s Hyde and its variant Nate Finch&amp;rsquo;s blog. It was heavily restructured with modularised page layouts for easier maintenance and modification. Hyde-hyde offers awesome features such as nice colour tone, code highlighting, Font-Awesome 5&amp;rsquo;s sidebar icons), a cool portfolio page, more choices for commenting (e.g. GraphComment, Disqus).</description>

      <title>Setting up a simple cleanup log in bash</title>
      <link>https://aays.github.io/post/setting-up-a-simple-cleanup-log-in-bash/</link>

      <description>A simple function to automatically append info about deleted files to a cleanup log!
Motivation (I originally wanted to just tweet this little trick out, but 140 characters is rarely sufficient for this sort of thing.)
Anyhow - sometimes, when dealing with large amounts of intermediate files in a project, it can be useful to log what&amp;rsquo;s being deleted when and where. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick bash trick for setting up a function that logs a) which files where deleted, b) when they were deleted, and c) how much space was freed up as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Endophytes as biocontrols for the Côte d’Ivoire Lethal Yellowing (CILY) disease</title>
      <link>https://aays.github.io/projects/cily/</link>

      <description>As part of my undergraduate research work, I attempted to identify endophytic microbes that may potentially be used as biocontrols against the Côte d’Ivoire Lethal Yellowing (CILY) disease, which had previously destroyed approximately 350 ha of coconut trees in the West African country. This was done by creating profiles of the microbial communities present within both infected and uninfected trees. A ‘dilution-to-extinction’ method of high-throughput culturing was used in order to cultivate both bacterial and fungal endophytes directly from samples collected from the town of Grand-Lahou, followed by molecular analyses for strain identification.</description>

      <description>I did my PhD in Prof. Rob Ness’s lab at the University of Toronto Mississauga. I am broadly interested in meiotic recombination, and used lab-based and computational approaches to better understand how recombination rate variation affects genome evolution.
Outside of my research work, I am also passionate about teaching programming skills for scientific research, with an emphasis on reproducible and open science. I have taught several Carpentries workshops over the course of my PhD, in addition to running programming workshops at my campus with UofT Coders.</description>
