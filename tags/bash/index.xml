      <description>A simple function to automatically append info about deleted files to a cleanup log!
Motivation (I originally wanted to just tweet this little trick out, but 140 characters is rarely sufficient for this sort of thing.)
Anyhow - sometimes, when dealing with large amounts of intermediate files in a project, it can be useful to log what&amp;rsquo;s being deleted when and where. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick bash trick for setting up a function that logs a) which files where deleted, b) when they were deleted, and c) how much space was freed up as a consequence.</description>
