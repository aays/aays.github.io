      <description>A bit of backstory So - my thesis work so far across my PhD has primarily concerned recombination: more specifically, variation in recombination rate across the genome, and how that affects genome evolution. That said, when the world came to a standstill in 2020, my next recombination-related project ground to a halt, with me unable to head into the lab at all.
Around this time, Rob (my supervisor) pitched this project on characterizing the mutation profiles of salt-adapted lines to me.</description>

      <description>Motivation Volvocine algae have been a model lineage for studying the evolutionary transition from isogamy (equal sized gametes) to anisogamy (unequal sized gametes). Instead of entire sex chromosomes, isogamous systems tend to have smaller and less differentiated mating type (MT) loci. Part of this putatively stems from these systems simply having less secondary sexual characteristics, and thus comparatively minimal need to segregate certain genes in one MT allele over another (under the sexually antagonistic selection model).</description>

      <description>In June of this year, I uploaded my first first-author (there has to be a cleaner way of saying that) manuscript to the preprint server BioRxiv. This was a huge and important milestone for me, and I was incredibly excited to have it out for the world to see virtually as soon as it was done &amp;ndash; such is the power of preprint servers!
Like in most endeavours in science, however, there&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have gotten some thorough feedback from both members of my committee as well as other researchers in the community at large.</description>
